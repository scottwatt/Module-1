# Code Refactor Starter Code

In this Module 1 Challenge, I was assigned to read a user story and an acceptance criteria. I had to make changes to the supplied code to meet the changes listed in the acceptance criteria. This lesson is designed to teach me about semantic HTML, CSS, and how the stylesheet interacts with the linked .html sheet. 

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

*WHEN I view the source code

THEN I find semantic HTML elements

*WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

*WHEN I view the image elements

THEN I find accessible alt attributes

*WHEN I view the heading attributes

THEN they fall in sequential order

*WHEN I view the title element

THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Work Completed

*Changes HTML to semantic HTML

*Adds company name to title

*Organizes CSS elements to logical structure

*Alphabetizes all CSS declarations

*Consolidates multiple CSS selectors into a single selector

*Adds comments to show changes and describe CSS

*Adds alt attribute to images
